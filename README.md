# FlipperZero-Experimentation
My experimentations with the Flipper Zero. After getting the Flipper Zero this is just a log of projects/ideas/research I've done surrounding it.
Links to resources will also be posted here for things I find useful for me in the future.

# Flipper Firmware
After using the stock firmware, I've installed the [Xtreme Firmware](https://github.com/Flipper-XFW/Xtreme-Firmware). Of all the features added in this custom firmware, the one that catches my eye for experimentation is the Bluetooth capabilities for the Bad USB.
